{ "issues": [ { "file": "lib/browserDocument.js", "line": null, "description": "The file acts as a browser stub for the Document class, overriding all methods to throw errors or do nothing. While not a 'bug', this can lead to runtime exceptions if browser code inadvertently calls server-only logic. This is intentional for browser builds but may trip up users if not documented." }, { "file": "lib/document.js", "line": null, "description": "The Document class is complex and handles schema, casting, validation, getters/setters, etc. There is potential for prototype pollution if untrusted input is merged into a document, especially via 'set' or 'update' methods that accept arbitrary objects. The code should take care to sanitize keys to prevent prototype pollution (e.g., keys like 'proto', 'constructor', 'prototype')." }, { "file": "lib/document.js", "line": null, "description": "Some error handling code (e.g., in validation, casting, or middleware calls) may catch broad exceptions or ignore return values. This can mask real bugs or allow exceptions to propagate in an unexpected way, possibly resulting in uncaught errors or data inconsistencies." }, { "file": "lib/documentProvider.js", "line": null, "description": "The provider pattern for Document classes depends on global state and mutation of the 'DocumentProvider' object. If used in concurrent or multi-tenant environments (e.g., serverless), this can lead to race conditions or incorrect Document classes being used." }, { "file": "lib/model.js", "line": null, "description": "The Model class's static methods (find, create, update, etc.) do not always validate that the schema is present and correct before running, which could lead to exceptions if a model is constructed incorrectly or the schema is mutated at runtime." }, { "file": "lib/model.js", "line": null, "description": "There is risk of injection if untrusted input is passed to methods like find, update, or aggregate without validation or sanitization. While Mongoose attempts to cast and sanitize input, improper use (such as passing user objects directly into queries) can result in NoSQL injection vulnerabilities." }, { "file": "test/common.js", "line": null, "description": "The test helpers may modify global state (such as setting global.Promise, monkey-patching timers, or modifying process.env) without resetting, which can cause side effects between tests or in test runners that parallelize execution." }, { "file": "test/helpers/document.getDeepestSubdocumentForPath.js", "line": null, "description": "If called with a malicious or malformed path, this function could throw or behave unpredictably if path traversal is not guarded. Defensive coding is needed to prevent prototype pollution or traversal of dangerous paths." }, { "file": "test/model.insertMany.test.js", "line": null, "description": "Tests may insert documents with invalid or edge-case data (e.g., objects with proto keys) without verifying that prototype pollution is prevented. This could mask a real vulnerability in the model code." }, { "file": "test/types/check-types-filename.js", "line": null, "description": "This script reads and manipulates file paths and names and could throw if run in an unexpected directory structure. If used in CI, ensure correct error handling and file existence checks." }, { "file": "test/util.js", "line": null, "description": "Test utility functions may catch exceptions or resolve Promises without proper error reporting, potentially causing silent test failures or masking real issues." } ] }
