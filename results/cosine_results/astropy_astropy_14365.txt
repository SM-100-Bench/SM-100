Consider using ast.literal_eval for safety or restrict the eval context." }, { "file": "astropy/io/ascii/src/tokenizer.c", "line": null, "description": "Potential buffer overflow: The tokenizer implementation does not appear to perform strict bounds checking when copying or manipulating input lines.
