{ "issues": [ { "file": "lib/broadcast-operator.ts", "line": null, "description": "No explicit validation for rooms or flags provided to the BroadcastOperator. Malicious or malformed input could cause unexpected behavior or errors if upstream code does not sanitize inputs." }, { "file": "lib/client.ts", "line": null, "description": "The 'Client' class does not appear to have protections against race conditions in concurrent operations (e.g., adding/removing sockets, closing connections). If accessed from multiple threads (unusual in Node.js, but possible with worker threads or in uws), this could result in undefined behavior." }, { "file": "lib/uws.ts", "line": null, "description": "The uws integration uses direct property assignment and assumes the underlying WebSocket implementation follows certain conventions. If upstream updates break compatibility, this could lead to runtime exceptions." }, { "file": "lib/socket.ts", "line": null, "description": "The 'Socket' implementation assumes that the attached client and namespace are always valid and does not always perform null/undefined checks before accessing their properties, which could lead to exceptions if these assumptions are violated." }, { "file": "test/support/util.ts", "line": null, "description": "Test utilities use timeouts and delays but do not always account for potential timer leakage or cleanup, which could affect the reliability of tests when run repeatedly or in parallel." }, { "file": "test/fixtures/server-close.ts", "line": null, "description": "Test fixture does not handle all error events, which may cause unhandled promise rejections or uncaught exceptions during test execution." }, { "file": "test/messaging-many.ts", "line": null, "description": "The test rapidly creates and tears down many connections but does not always ensure cleanup of resources, which could result in resource exhaustion or port binding issues on repeated test runs." }, { "file": "lib/typed-events.ts", "line": null, "description": "TypeScript utility file for typed events relies on type assertions and overloads that, if misused, could bypass type safety and result in runtime errors (though this is more a limitation of TypeScript than a logic bug)." } ] }
