This can cause the generator to hang or result in undefined behavior." }, { "file": "src/test/asyncjs/async.js", "line": 190, "description": "In the 'forEach'/'each' method, if 'fn' throws synchronously, the error is caught and delivered to 'next', but the generator continues processing. This may cause state corruption or missed cleanup if errors are not properly handled in callbacks." }, { "file": "src/test/asyncjs/async.js", "line": 380, "description": "In the 'toArray' method, errors are collected into the 'errors' array if breakOnError is false, but there is no guarantee that the errors array is the same length as 'values'. If some items have no errors, the errors array may not align with values, leading to confusion for consumers." }, { "file": "src/test/mockdom.js", "line": 455, "description": "In the Node.prototype.insertBefore implementation, the calculation of the insertion index 'i' as 'this.childNodes.length + 1' when 'before' is not found can result in a gap (i.e., pushing undefined). This is not standard DOM behavior and can lead to incorrect tree structure." }, { "file": "src/test/mockdom.js", "line": 121, "description": "In Context2d.prototype.getImageData, the first loop uses 'for (var i = sx; i < sw + sy; i++)', which appears to be a copy-paste error and probably should be 'for (var i = sx; i < sw + sx; i++)'. This will result in incorrect image data extraction." }, { "file": "src/test/mockdom.js", "line": 421, "description": "In setInnerHTML, 'attributes && attributes.replace(...)' does not check that the attribute string is well-formed. Malformed HTML may cause unexpected exceptions or silent failures." }, { "file": "src/test/mockdom.js", "line": 692, "description": "window.btoa and window.atob are defined only if 'Buffer' is defined, but no fallback is provided for browser-like environments, making code using these methods fail outside Node.js." }, { "file": "src/test/mockdom.js", "line": 770, "description": "In exports.loadInBrowser, the method directly deletes 'global.ResizeObserver' and other properties. This can break code in non-test environments if used improperly and should be guarded." }, { "file": "src/test/mockdom.js", "line": 930, "description": "exports.load() is called unconditionally at the end of the file, which modifies global properties. This may interfere with other code if the module is loaded outside of a test environment." }, { "file": "src/test/user.js", "line": 97, "description": "In sendKey, the 'emit' function does not check for the existence of 'KeyboardEvent' on all platforms. In some headless environments or old browsers, this may throw an exception." }, { "file": "src/test/user.js", "line": 143, "description": "In updateTextInput, the logic for handling backspace (keyCode == 8) and delete (keyCode == 46) is incorrect: it only changes the start and end indices, but for backspace, if s != e, it reduces s, which can result in s < 0 and slice errors." }, { "file": "src/test/user.js", "line": 143, "description": "In updateTextInput, if the selection is collapsed (s == e), pressing backspace or delete does not remove any character, which is not standard behavior for text inputs." } ] }
