{ "issues": [ { "file": "lint/linter.go", "line": 85, "description": "Goroutine leak and program termination: In the Linter.Lint method, if l.lintPackage returns an error, the error is printed and os.Exit(1) is called inside a goroutine. This can cause abrupt program termination from a non-main goroutine, which is unsafe and may leave resources in an inconsistent state. Additionally, os.Exit does not run deferred cleanup, so WaitGroup.Done() will not be called, potentially causing a deadlock if other goroutines are still running." }, { "file": "lint/linter.go", "line": 99, "description": "WaitGroup.Done() is deferred after l.lintPackage, but if l.lintPackage panics or calls os.Exit, WaitGroup.Done() will not be called, risking deadlock on wg.Wait()." }, { "file": "lint/file.go", "line": 44, "description": "The Render method panics if printer.Fprint returns an error, which could crash the program if the AST is malformed or the printer fails.
