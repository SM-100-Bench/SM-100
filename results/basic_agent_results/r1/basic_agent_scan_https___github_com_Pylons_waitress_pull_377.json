The close() method may not properly check if the socket is already closed, leading to exceptions when closing an already-closed socket.", "file": "src/waitress/wasyncore.py", "line": 150}, {"description": "Incomplete handling of socket closure during receive operations. Missing check for empty return value from socket recv() indicating peer closure, which could lead to infinite loops or hung connections.", "file": "src/waitress/receiver.py", "line": 82}, {"description": "Unbounded buffer growth due to missing consumed data cleanup. The buffer class may retain already-consumed data indefinitely, creating memory pressure with large/long-lived connections.", "file": "src/waitress/buffers.py", "line": 67}], "updated_files": {}}
