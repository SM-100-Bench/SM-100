{"repo_id": "psf_requests_6028", "bugs": [{"description": "In utils.super_len, the code assumes that any object having a fileno() also possesses the attribute `mode`. Many legitimate file-like objects (e.g., objects returned by `tempfile.TemporaryFile()` or sockets wrapped with makefile()) expose `fileno()` but **do not** define a `mode` attribute. Accessing `o.mode` will therefore raise `AttributeError`, leading to crashes when such objects are passed to Requests. `o.mode` should be obtained with `getattr(o, 'mode', '')` (or similar) before the membership test.", "file": "requests/utils.py", "line": 136}], "updated_files": {}}
