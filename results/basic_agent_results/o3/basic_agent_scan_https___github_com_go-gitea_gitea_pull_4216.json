However, when XORM\u2019s ID(id) is used, any non-primary key conditions carried in the bean are ignored. Thus the generated SQL WHERE clause only matches on the token ID, not the UID, so any caller who knows a token ID can delete another user\u2019s token. This is an authorization bypass vulnerability.", "file": "models/token.go", "line": 73}], "updated_files": {}}
