If the caller does not pass srcCharCode (i.e. srcCharCode is None), the code falls back to setting self.src = src and never initializes self.srcCharCode. The later for-loop `for pos, character in enumerate(self.srcCharCode):` will then raise an AttributeError because self.srcCharCode does not exist. Either self.srcCharCode must be set in both branches or the loop should use self.src (with ord() mapping) instead.", "file": "markdown_it/rules_block/state_block.py", "line": 82}], "updated_files": {}}
