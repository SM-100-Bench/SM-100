{"repo_id": "Pylons_waitress_377", "bugs": [{"description": "In POSIX implementation of trigger._physical_pull(), the code writes a byte to the pipe without catching exceptions. If the pipe\u2019s buffer becomes full (EAGAIN / BlockingIOError), os.write will raise, which can propagate out of pull_trigger() and crash the calling thread or even the whole application. The method should catch EAGAIN and silently ignore (or flush) because the wake-up signal has already been queued, or otherwise handle the error gracefully.", "file": "src/waitress/trigger.py", "line": 87}], "updated_files": {}}
