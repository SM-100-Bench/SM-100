When no timeout is specified, `this.flags.timeout` is `undefined`, resulting in the timer firing immediately (delay 0). This prematurely triggers the acknowledgement callback with a timeout error even though no timeout was intended.", "file": "lib/broadcast-operator.ts", "line": 236}, {"description": "In BroadcastOperator.emit(), a timeout timer is unconditionally created with `setTimeout()` using `this.flags.timeout` as delay (line 236).
