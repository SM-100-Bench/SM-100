{"repo_id": "go-sql-driver_mysql_943", "bugs": [{"description": "In stmt.query(), when the first result set has zero columns (resLen == 0), rows.mc is **not** assigned before NextResultSet is called. nextResultSet/nextNotEmptyResultSet expect rows.mc to be non-nil and will immediately return io.EOF if it is nil. This causes subsequent non-empty result sets to be skipped, leading to loss of data and incorrect behavior for statements that return an initial OK packet followed by one or more result sets (e.g., CALL to a stored procedure). rows.mc should be set to `mc` unconditionally before it is used.", "file": "statement.go", "line": 90}], "updated_files": {}}
