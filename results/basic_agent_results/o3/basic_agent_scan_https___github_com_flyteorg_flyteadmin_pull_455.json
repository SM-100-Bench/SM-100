{"repo_id": "flyteorg_flyteadmin_455", "bugs": [{"description": "NewCsrfToken uses math/rand with a predictable seed (time-based) and reseeds the global RNG every call. This produces low-entropy, potentially duplicate CSRF tokens and is a security vulnerability. It should use crypto/rand and avoid reseeding the global source.", "file": "auth/cookie.go", "line": 114}, {"description": "NewSecureCookie does not set HttpOnly or Secure attributes on cookies that store sensitive tokens (access_token, id_token, refresh_token, user info, etc.). Without HttpOnly, client-side scripts can read these cookies, creating XSS risks, and without Secure the cookies may be sent over unencrypted connections. Both flags should be explicitly set (HttpOnly=true and Secure=true when using HTTPS).", "file": "auth/cookie.go", "line": 54}], "updated_files": {}}
