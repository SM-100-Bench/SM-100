{"repo_id": "nvbn_thefuck_1206", "bugs": [{"description": "The rule file `thefuck/rules/test.py.py` is given a double `.py` extension. When rules are dynamically loaded in `thefuck/types.py`, the filename is trimmed with `path.name[:-3]`, producing the module name `test.py` (contains a dot). `imp.load_source()` then registers this as sub-module `test.py` under the existing standard-library package `test`, polluting / shadowing the stdlib package and its sub-modules. This can unintentionally override `import test` behavior elsewhere and may also break if the standard library `test` package is not expected to have a `py` sub-module, leading to confusing import\u2010related errors.", "file": "thefuck/rules/test.py.py", "line": 1}], "updated_files": {}}
