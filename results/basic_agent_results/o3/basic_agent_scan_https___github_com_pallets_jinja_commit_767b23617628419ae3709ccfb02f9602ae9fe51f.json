The chained comparison 'a != b != c' only checks a != b and b != c, but does NOT ensure a != c. This could allow block_start_string and comment_start_string to be equal without triggering the assertion, leading to ambiguous parsing and incorrect behaviour.", "file": "src/jinja2/environment.py", "line": 131}], "updated_files": {}}
