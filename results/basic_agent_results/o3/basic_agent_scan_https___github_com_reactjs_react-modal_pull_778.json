{"repo_id": "reactjs_react-modal_778", "bugs": [{"description": "ModalPortal.open() calls focusManager.setupScopedFocus(this.node), but 'this.node' is never assigned anywhere in ModalPortal. As a result 'undefined' is passed, leaving focusManager.modalElement null. When the blur/focus handlers later run, they execute modalElement.contains(...), which throws a TypeError (\"Cannot read property 'contains' of null/undefined\") and can crash the application when the modal is opened. The method should pass a valid DOM element, probably the overlay or content element (e.g., this.content or this.overlay), or set this.node accordingly before use.", "file": "src/components/ModalPortal.js", "line": 203}], "updated_files": {}}
