{"repo_id": "mgechev_revive_1101", "bugs": [{"description": "Function Linter.Lint starts a goroutine per package which, on any error from l.lintPackage, prints the error and calls os.Exit(1). Because this is executed inside a library routine and inside a child goroutine, the entire process terminates abruptly, bypassing the caller\u2019s error-handling path and making the error return value of Lint useless. Library code should return the error to the caller instead of exiting the process.", "file": "lint/linter.go", "line": 74}], "updated_files": {}}
