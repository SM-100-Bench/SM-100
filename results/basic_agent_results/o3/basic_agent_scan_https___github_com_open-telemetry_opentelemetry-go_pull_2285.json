The code keeps the brackets, causing net.ParseIP to fail and mis-classifies the address as a name (NetPeerName) instead of an IP (NetPeerIP). This produces wrong attributes and may break downstream processing.", "file": "semconv/v1.4.0/http.go", "line": 56}, {"description": "HTTPClientAttributesFromHTTPRequest temporarily sets request.URL.User = nil to remove userinfo before adding HTTPURL attribute, then restores it. This mutates the *http.Request object that may be used concurrently by other goroutines, leading to data races or unexpected behavior, because http.Request is not safe for concurrent writes. Instead, a copy of the URL should be used.", "file": "semconv/v1.4.0/http.go", "line": 151}], "updated_files": {}}
