This masks potential bugs where from_pos could be out of bounds for the bMarks, tShift, or eMarks arrays. The silent exception handling could hide legitimate index errors and make debugging difficult. The method should properly validate bounds or handle the specific case where the index might be invalid.", "file": "markdown_it/rules_block/state_block.py", "line": 148}, {"description": "In the list_block function, line 135 calls int() on a string slice without error handling. If the string slice contains non-numeric characters or is empty, this will raise a ValueError and crash the program. The skipOrderedListMarker function should ensure the slice contains only digits, but there's no defensive programming here to handle edge cases.", "file": "markdown_it/rules_block/list.py", "line": 135}, {"description": "In the HTML_SEQUENCES list, lines 26 and 30 contain regex patterns with double backslashes (\\\\s) which will be interpreted as literal backslash followed by 's' rather than the intended whitespace character class \\s. This should be a raw string (r\"...\") or use single backslash in a raw string context.", "file": "markdown_it/rules_block/html_block.py", "line": 26}, {"description": "In the HTML_SEQUENCES list, line 30 contains a regex pattern with double backslashes (\\\\s) which will be interpreted as literal backslash followed by 's' rather than the intended whitespace character class \\s.
