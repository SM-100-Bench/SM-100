The code assumes that strings.Split(s, \" unlock \") will always return at least 2 elements and directly accesses index [1] without checking the length.

The code performs a direct type assertion to bool without checking if the value exists or is of the correct type.

When an invalid output format is provided, the function returns OutputFormatJSON along with an error. This is misleading because the caller might use the returned value even when an error occurred.
