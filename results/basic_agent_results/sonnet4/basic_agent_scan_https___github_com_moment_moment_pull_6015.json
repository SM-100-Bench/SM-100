{"repo_id": "moment_moment_6015", "bugs": [{"description": "The calculateOffset function doesn't properly handle negative timezone offsets. When numOffset is negative (e.g., '-0500'), parseInt(numOffset, 10) returns -500, but the calculation 'h * 60 + m' where h = (-500 - 0) / 100 = -5 and m = -500 % 100 = 0 works correctly. However, for values like '-0530', h = (-530 - (-30)) / 100 = -5 and m = -530 % 100 = -30, so the result becomes -5 * 60 + (-30) = -330, which is incorrect. It should be -5 * 60 - 30 = -330. The issue is that the modulo operation on negative numbers in JavaScript returns a negative result, but we want the minutes to be subtracted from the hours, not added as a negative.", "file": "src/lib/create/from-string.js", "line": 188}, {"description": "The unescapeFormat function on line 68 uses .replace('\\\\', '') which only replaces the first occurrence of a backslash. If the input string contains multiple backslashes, only the first one will be removed. This should use a global regex like .replace(/\\\\/g, '') to remove all backslashes, or the logic may be incorrect for strings with multiple escape sequences.", "file": "src/lib/parse/regex.js", "line": 68}, {"description": "In the configFromObject function, line 15 uses 'obj && parseInt(obj, 10)' which will return 0 (falsy) for the string '0', null, undefined, or false values, when the intent might be to preserve null/undefined for missing values. For example, if i.year is the string '0', this expression returns 0, but if i.year is null or undefined, it also returns null/undefined. However, if i.year is the number 0, 'obj && parseInt(obj, 10)' will return 0 && parseInt(0, 10) which evaluates to 0 (falsy) and returns 0. The issue is that this logic doesn't distinguish between an explicit 0 value and a missing value, which could lead to incorrect date parsing.", "file": "src/lib/create/from-object.js", "line": 15}, {"description": "In the configFromInput function, lines 74-76 process array input by applying parseInt(obj, 10) to each element without checking if the element is actually parseable as a number. If the array contains non-numeric values like strings that can't be parsed as numbers, parseInt will return NaN, which could lead to invalid date creation. For example, an input array like [2023, 'invalid', 15] would result in [2023, NaN, 15], potentially causing unexpected behavior in date creation.", "file": "src/lib/create/from-anything.js", "line": 75}, {"description": "In the checkWeekday function, line 164-168 creates a Date object using parsedInput[0] (year), parsedInput[1] (month), and parsedInput[2] (day). However, JavaScript Date constructor expects month to be 0-based (0-11), but the parsedInput[1] from RFC2822 parsing is likely 1-based (1-12) since it comes from defaultLocaleMonthsShort.indexOf() which returns the index of the month name. This means the Date object will be created with the wrong month, leading to incorrect weekday validation.", "file": "src/lib/create/from-string.js", "line": 166}, {"description": "In the checkOverflow function, line 23 calls daysInMonth(a[YEAR], a[MONTH]) but doesn't handle the case where a[YEAR] or a[MONTH] might be null, undefined, or NaN. If either value is invalid, daysInMonth could return an incorrect result or throw an error, leading to improper overflow detection.
