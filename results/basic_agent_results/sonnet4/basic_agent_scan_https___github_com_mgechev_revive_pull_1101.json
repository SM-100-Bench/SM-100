{"repo_id": "mgechev_revive_1101", "bugs": [{"description": "The defer statement is placed after error handling code that calls os.Exit(1). This means wg.Done() will never be called if an error occurs, potentially causing a deadlock in the WaitGroup. The defer should be placed immediately after wg.Add(1) to ensure it's always executed.", "file": "lint/linter.go", "line": 112}, {"description": "Calling os.Exit(1) in a goroutine is problematic as it terminates the entire program immediately without allowing proper cleanup, graceful shutdown, or other goroutines to complete. This can lead to data corruption, resource leaks, or incomplete operations. The error should be handled more gracefully, perhaps by sending the error through a channel or using a different error handling mechanism.", "file": "lint/linter.go", "line": 110}, {"description": "The Render method panics when printer.Fprint returns an error. This can cause the entire program to crash unexpectedly. Instead of panicking, the method should handle the error gracefully by returning an error or a default value, allowing the calling code to decide how to handle the failure.", "file": "lint/file.go", "line": 54}, {"description": "The condition logic is incorrect. It checks `len(existing) > 1` but should check `len(existing) > 0`. When the slice is empty (len=0), the condition `len(existing) == 0 && isEnabled` will be true for enable operations, but when there's exactly one element (len=1), the first part of the OR condition will be false, potentially allowing duplicate consecutive operations of the same type.", "file": "lint/file.go", "line": 180}, {"description": "The condition `dir == \".\"` in the loop termination check is problematic. On Windows systems, the current directory might be represented differently, and this check might not work as expected. Additionally, the function could get stuck in an infinite loop if filepath.Dir(dir) returns the same value as dir (which can happen at filesystem roots on some systems). A more robust approach would be to check if the directory hasn't changed after calling filepath.Dir().", "file": "lint/linter.go", "line": 183}, {"description": "Potential index out of bounds error when accessing match[rulesPos] and match[reasonPos]. The code checks if len(match) == 0 but doesn't verify that the match slice has enough elements to safely access rulesPos (which is 3) and reasonPos (which is 4). If the regex matches but captures fewer groups than expected, this will cause a panic.", "file": "lint/file.go", "line": 215}, {"description": "Another potential index out of bounds error when accessing match[modifierPos] and match[directivePos] in the handleRules call. Similar to the previous issue, the code doesn't verify that the match slice has enough elements before accessing these indices. Since modifierPos is 2 and directivePos is 1, and these are optional capture groups in the regex, accessing them without bounds checking can cause a panic.", "file": "lint/file.go", "line": 243}], "updated_files": {}}
