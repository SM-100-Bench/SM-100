When an unknown itemType is encountered, the panic statement calls itype.String() recursively, which will cause a stack overflow. The panic should use a different format or convert itype to int.", "file": "conf/lex.go", "line": 1194}, {"description": "Index out of bounds error in popContext() method. When len(p.ctxs) == 1, after removing the last element on line 169, p.ctxs becomes empty, but line 170 tries to access p.ctxs[len(p.ctxs)-1] which would be p.ctxs[-1], causing a panic.", "file": "conf/parse.go", "line": 170}, {"description": "Missing fallthrough or return statement in lexMapKeyStart() method. In the commentSlashStart case (lines 645-652), when the second character is not commentSlashStart, the code calls backup() but then falls through to the next case without a return statement or explicit fallthrough, causing unintended execution of subsequent code.", "file": "conf/lex.go", "line": 652}, {"description": "Potential index out of bounds in lexBlock() method. The function calls lx.backup() twice (lines 883-884) without checking if there are enough characters to back up. If the lexer is at position 0 or 1, calling backup() twice could cause the position to become negative, leading to undefined behavior.", "file": "conf/lex.go", "line": 884}, {"description": "backup() method can cause negative position. The backup() method subtracts lx.width from lx.pos without checking if lx.pos >= lx.width, which could result in a negative position.

If an unrecognized suffix is provided (not matching any of the cases from lines 252-277), the code silently does nothing instead of setting the value or returning an error. This could lead to unexpected behavior where the value is not set.", "file": "conf/parse.go", "line": 278}, {"description": "Potential infinite recursion in variable lookup. The lookupVariable() method calls Parse() recursively on line 399 when processing environment variables.

The isVariable() method modifies lx.start by incrementing it (line 790) when a variable is detected.
