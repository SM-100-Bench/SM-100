If the config file contains malformed JSON, JSON.parse() will throw an exception that could crash the application. The error is caught but then re-thrown, which could expose sensitive information about the file system structure.", "file": "/var/folders/hp/rv5nbb3140l0404lfjq_pq140000gn/T/tmp5ewm7a84/loader.js", "line": 173}, {"description": "File system error: fs.unlinkSync() is called without checking if the pidfile exists first.
