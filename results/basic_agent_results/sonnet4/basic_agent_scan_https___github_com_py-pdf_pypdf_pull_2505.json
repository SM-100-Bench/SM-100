{"repo_id": "py-pdf_pypdf_2505", "bugs": [{"description": "Operator precedence bug in insert_blank_page method. The condition 'width is None or height is None and (self._get_num_pages() - 1) >= index' has incorrect operator precedence. Due to 'and' having higher precedence than 'or', this evaluates as 'width is None or (height is None and (self._get_num_pages() - 1) >= index)' instead of the intended '(width is None or height is None) and (self._get_num_pages() - 1) >= index'. This could lead to incorrect behavior when only width is None but height is provided, potentially causing the method to skip getting dimensions from an existing page when it should.", "file": "pypdf/_writer.py", "line": 526}, {"description": "Missing excluded_keys parameter in insert_page method. The insert_page method accepts an excluded_keys parameter but doesn't pass it to the _add_page method call. This means the excluded_keys parameter is completely ignored, which could lead to unexpected behavior when users expect certain keys to be excluded during page insertion but they are not actually excluded.", "file": "pypdf/_writer.py", "line": 418}, {"description": "Potential ValueError in get_reference method. The method uses 'self._objects.index(obj)' which will raise a ValueError if the object is not found in the list. There is no error handling for this case, which could cause the program to crash with an unhandled exception when trying to get a reference for an object that doesn't exist in the _objects list.", "file": "pypdf/_writer.py", "line": 1541}, {"description": "Potential IndexError in _trim_outline method. The line 'new_outline.append(outline[i - 1])' could cause an IndexError if 'i' is 0, since 'outline[-1]' would access the last element of the list instead of the intended previous element. When i=0, there is no previous element, so this should either be handled with a bounds check or the logic should be restructured to avoid this edge case.", "file": "pypdf/_merger.py", "line": 466}], "updated_files": {}}
