{"repo_id": "gridstack_gridstack.js_2712", "bugs": [{"description": "Type safety issue: The `toNumber` function has a return type annotation of `number` but actually returns `undefined` in some cases. This violates the type contract and could lead to runtime errors when callers expect a number but receive undefined. The function should either return `number | undefined` or return a default number value like 0 when the input is null or empty.", "file": "src/utils.ts", "line": 221}, {"description": "Potential null pointer exception: In the constructor of DDDraggable class, the code accesses `option.handle.substring(1)` without checking if `option.handle` is defined. If `option.handle` is undefined or null, this will throw a runtime error. The code should check if `option.handle` exists before calling substring on it.", "file": "src/dd-draggable.ts", "line": 82}, {"description": "Potential infinite loop: In the `findEmptyPosition` method, the for loop `for (let i = start; !found; ++i)` has no upper bound check. If no empty position is found (which could happen in a full grid or with certain constraints), this loop will run indefinitely, causing the application to hang. The loop should have a reasonable upper bound or timeout mechanism to prevent infinite execution.", "file": "src/gridstack-engine.ts", "line": 501}, {"description": "Type inconsistency: The `findCacheLayout` method has a return type annotation of `number | undefined` but it actually returns `number` in all cases due to the `?? -1` fallback. The method will never return `undefined` because the nullish coalescing operator ensures it returns -1 when the findIndex operation cannot be performed. The return type should be `number` instead of `number | undefined`.", "file": "src/gridstack-engine.ts", "line": 949}], "updated_files": {}}
