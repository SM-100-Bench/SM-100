This appears to be a bug where the code should check if blocks[index] exists (to validate the index is within bounds) but the result is discarded. This could lead to an IndexError being raised instead of the intended LookupError, causing the wrong exception handling path to be taken.", "file": "src/jinja2/runtime.py", "line": 193}, {"description": "In the LoopContext.length property, line 449 has a bug in the length calculation. When the iterable is a generator and needs to be converted to a list, the calculation `len(iterable) + self.index + (self._after is not missing)` is incorrect. The `self.index` represents the current iteration count (starting at 1), but this should not be added to the length of the remaining items. This will result in an incorrect total length that's too large by the current index value.", "file": "src/jinja2/runtime.py", "line": 449}, {"description": "In the AsyncLoopContext.length property, line 610 has the same bug as in LoopContext. The length calculation `len(iterable) + self.index + (self._after is not missing)` is incorrect. When the async iterable is converted to a list, the `self.index` (current iteration count starting at 1) should not be added to the length of the remaining items. This will result in an incorrect total length that's too large by the current index value.", "file": "src/jinja2/runtime.py", "line": 610}], "updated_files": {}}
