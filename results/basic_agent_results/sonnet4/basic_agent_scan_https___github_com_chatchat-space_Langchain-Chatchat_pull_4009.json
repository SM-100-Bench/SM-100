If the KnowledgeFile constructor fails on line 331-332, the variable 'kb_file' will not be defined, but it's referenced in the exception handler on line 342.

The parameter 'docs' (Dict[str, Document]) is being shadowed by a local variable 'docs' (List) on line 197. This makes the original parameter inaccessible after line 197, but the code continues to iterate over 'docs.items()' on line 199, which will fail because the local 'docs' is now a list, not a dictionary.", "file": "server/knowledge_base/kb_service/base.py", "line": 197}, {"description": "Duplicate condition in KBServiceFactory.get_service method. The condition 'SupportedVSType.DEFAULT == vector_store_type' appears twice - once on line 331 and again on line 341. The second occurrence will never be reached because the first one handles the same case.
