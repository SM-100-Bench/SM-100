The field is annotated as 'date | None' but uses 'as_aware_datetime' converter which converts to datetime objects. Additionally, line 94 assigns self._last_fire_date (which can be None) to previous_date: date without null checking, which would cause a TypeError when _last_fire_date is None.", "file": "src/apscheduler/triggers/calendarinterval.py", "line": 80}, {"description": "Redundant assignment in CronTrigger.__attrs_post_init__. Line 97 assigns self._last_fire_time = None, but this field is already initialized with default=None on line 81-82.

On line 85, the code performs 'self._next_fire_times[i] - earliest_fire_time' but self._next_fire_times[i] could be None (as set on line 86 when triggers[i].next() returns None). This would cause a TypeError when trying to subtract datetime from None. The code should check for None before performing the subtraction.", "file": "src/apscheduler/triggers/combining.py", "line": 85}, {"description": "Potential TypeError in AndTrigger.next() method.
