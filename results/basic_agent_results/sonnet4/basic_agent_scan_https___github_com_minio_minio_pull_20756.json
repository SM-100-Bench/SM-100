The code performs unsafe type assertions `w.(http.Flusher).Flush()` without checking if the ResponseWriter implements the http.Flusher interface. If the ResponseWriter doesn't implement http.Flusher, this will cause a runtime panic.", "file": "cmd/admin-bucket-handlers.go", "line": 1042}, {"description": "Another unsafe type assertion panic in ReplicationMRFHandler. Similar to the previous issue, the code performs `w.(http.Flusher).Flush()` without checking if the ResponseWriter implements the http.Flusher interface, which can cause a runtime panic.", "file": "cmd/admin-bucket-handlers.go", "line": 1101}, {"description": "Potential nil pointer dereference in SetRemoteTargetHandler. On line 203, the code references `err` in the error message but `err` is nil at that point since it was only used in the condition `if target.Arn == \"\"` which doesn't set err. This could lead to unexpected behavior in error reporting.", "file": "cmd/admin-bucket-handlers.go", "line": 203}], "updated_files": {}}
