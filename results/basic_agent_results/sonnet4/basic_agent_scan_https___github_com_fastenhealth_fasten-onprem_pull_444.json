{"repo_id": "fastenhealth_fasten-onprem_444", "bugs": [{"description": "The FhirPathPipe.transform method returns null instead of an empty string when no resource is provided or no path queries match. This could cause template binding issues in Angular as null values may not render properly. The method should return an empty string '' instead of null for consistent string output.", "file": "frontend/src/app/pipes/fhir-path.pipe.ts", "line": 12}, {"description": "The FilterPipe.transform method has multiple issues: 1) It returns null instead of an empty array when no items are provided or no matches are found, which could cause template iteration errors. 2) It doesn't handle cases where items[field] might be null/undefined, which would cause a runtime error when calling toLowerCase(). The method should return an empty array [] instead of null and add null checks for the field access.", "file": "frontend/src/app/pipes/filter.pipe.ts", "line": 30}, {"description": "The DatasetLatestEntryPipe has a potential null reference error on line 40. If lastItemValue is null or undefined after the roundToDecimalPlaces call, calling toString() on it will throw a runtime error. The method should check if lastItemValue is valid before calling toString().", "file": "frontend/src/app/pipes/dataset-latest-entry.pipe.ts", "line": 40}, {"description": "The HumanNamePipe.transform method returns null when humanNameModel is falsy, but it should return an empty string for consistency with other string-returning pipes. Additionally, the getDisplayName method doesn't handle cases where givenName or familyName might be null/undefined, which could result in 'undefined undefined' being displayed.", "file": "frontend/src/app/pipes/human-name.pipe.ts", "line": 14}, {"description": "The FastenDisplayModelPipe.transform method throws errors instead of handling edge cases gracefully. In Angular pipes, throwing errors can crash the entire template rendering. The pipe should return null or a default value instead of throwing errors on lines 15 and 26, especially since this is used in template bindings where data might be loading asynchronously.", "file": "frontend/src/app/pipes/fasten-display-model.pipe.ts", "line": 15}, {"description": "The SafeHtmlPipe.transform method throws an error for invalid safe types instead of handling it gracefully. This could crash template rendering when an invalid type is passed. The pipe should return the original value or null instead of throwing an error on line 17.", "file": "frontend/src/app/pipes/safe-html.pipe.ts", "line": 17}, {"description": "The Base64 utility class doesn't handle invalid base64 strings or encoding errors. The atob() and btoa() functions can throw DOMException errors for invalid input. The methods should include try-catch blocks to handle these exceptions gracefully.", "file": "frontend/src/lib/utils/base64.ts", "line": 6}, {"description": "The uuidV4() function uses @ts-ignore to suppress TypeScript errors and has a complex one-liner implementation that may not be reliable across all browsers. The crypto.getRandomValues() method might not be available in all environments (like older browsers or some Node.js contexts). A more robust implementation or proper error handling should be used.", "file": "frontend/src/lib/utils/uuid.ts", "line": 4}], "updated_files": {}}
