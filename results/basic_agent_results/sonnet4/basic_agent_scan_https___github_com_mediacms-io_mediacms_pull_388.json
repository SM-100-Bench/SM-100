{"repo_id": "mediacms-io_mediacms_388", "bugs": [{"description": "In MediaListRow.tsx, the component tries to access props.children but children is not defined in the MediaListRowProps interface. This will cause a TypeScript compilation error since the component is trying to access a property that doesn't exist in the props type definition.", "file": "./frontend/src/static/js/components/MediaListRow.tsx", "line": 18}, {"description": "In MediaPlayer.js line 80, there's a bug where opt.subtitles.default is being assigned defaults.options.subtitles instead of defaults.options.subtitles.default. This will assign the entire subtitles object instead of just the default value, which could cause type errors and unexpected behavior.", "file": "./frontend/packages/player/src/MediaPlayer.js", "line": 80}, {"description": "In requests.js, the async functions getRequest, postRequest, putRequest, and deleteRequest have a logical flaw. When sync=false, they still use async/await syntax but don't return the promise, making the async keyword meaningless. The functions should either return the promise when sync=false, or not be declared as async when they don't need to await anything in the non-sync path.", "file": "./frontend/src/static/js/utils/helpers/requests.js", "line": 3}, {"description": "In VideoPlayer.jsx line 183, the code calls videojs(videoElemRef.current).dispose() but videojs is not imported. This will cause a ReferenceError at runtime when unsetPlayer() is called. The videojs library should be imported or accessed through the MediaPlayer instance.", "file": "./frontend/src/static/js/components/video-player/VideoPlayer.jsx", "line": 183}, {"description": "In MediaShareEmbed.jsx lines 118-122, there's a useEffect hook without a dependency array that runs on every render. This will cause the component to continuously update the state (setMaxHeight, setRightMiddlePositionTop, setRightMiddlePositionBottom) on every render, leading to an infinite re-render loop and performance issues. The useEffect should have an empty dependency array [] or proper dependencies.", "file": "./frontend/src/static/js/components/media-actions/MediaShareEmbed.jsx", "line": 118}, {"description": "In MediaItem.js line 50-52, there's a method named 'element()' that conflicts with the property 'this.element' defined in line 20. This creates a naming conflict where the method shadows the property. When calling 'element()', it will return the DOM element, but accessing 'this.element' directly might be confusing. The method should be renamed to something like 'getElement()' to avoid confusion.", "file": "./frontend/src/static/js/components/item-list/includes/itemLists/MediaItem.js", "line": 50}, {"description": "In SearchField.js lines 34-37, there's a useEffect hook without a dependency array that runs on every render. This will cause the component to continuously add and remove event listeners on every render, leading to memory leaks and performance issues.

The function returns keys[i + 1] but doesn't check if i + 1 is within the array bounds. If i is the last index of the array, keys[i + 1] will be undefined. This could happen when the loop reaches the end and tries to access an index beyond the array length.", "file": "./frontend/src/static/js/components/media-viewer/VideoViewer/functions.js", "line": 241}], "updated_files": {}}
