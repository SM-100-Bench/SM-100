The current implementation will not properly catch and handle React errors. The componentDidCatch method alone is insufficient - the component needs state to track error status and getDerivedStateFromError to update state when an error occurs.", "file": "./packages/editor/src/main.tsx", "line": 9}, {"description": "Missing break statement in switch case. In the OptimizingToCompiled case, there's a case for 'UpdateResp' that has no implementation and falls through to the next case without a break statement. This could cause unexpected behavior.", "file": "./packages/editor/src/worker/OptimizerWorker.ts", "line": 432}, {"description": "Potential null pointer exception in addRenderedLabels function. On line 179, svgCache.get(key)! uses the non-null assertion operator without checking if the value exists in the svgCache. If the key doesn't exist in svgCache, this will throw a runtime error.", "file": "./packages/editor/src/worker/common.ts", "line": 179}, {"description": "Type mismatch in useResampleDiagram function. On line 203-204, the code tries to cast diagramWorkerState contents to string, but based on the state structure, diagramWorkerState should contain an object with properties like 'id', 'compiling', 'optimizing', not a string directly. This will cause runtime errors when trying to use 'id' as a string.", "file": "./packages/editor/src/state/callbacks.ts", "line": 203}], "updated_files": {}}
