Line 609 uses this._view.views.values() suggesting it's a Map or similar collection, but all other lines (149, 150, 151, 206, 290, etc.) treat it as an array with methods like indexOf(), slice(), and direct indexing. This will cause a runtime error since arrays don't have a values() method that returns an iterator, or if it is a Map, the array methods will fail.", "file": "src/dom/epub/flow.ts", "line": 609}], "updated_files": {}}
