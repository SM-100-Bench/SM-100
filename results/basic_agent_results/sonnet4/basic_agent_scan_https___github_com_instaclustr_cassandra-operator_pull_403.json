The for loop at line 277 uses `for _ = range time.NewTicker(2 * time.Second).C` which creates a ticker that will run indefinitely without any timeout or maximum iteration limit. If the backup operation gets stuck in RUNNING or PENDING state and never transitions to COMPLETED or FAILED, this will create a goroutine leak and consume resources indefinitely. The ticker is also never stopped, causing a resource leak.", "file": "pkg/controller/cassandrabackup/cassandrabackup_controller.go", "line": 277}, {"description": "Error handling issue with empty error message logging. Line 371 uses println() instead of proper logging and provides a generic error message without the actual error details. This makes debugging difficult and doesn't follow the established logging patterns in the codebase.

The remove function at lines 124-131 modifies the slice while iterating over it, which can lead to skipping elements or index out of bounds errors. When an element is removed using append(list[:i], list[i+1:]...), the slice is modified in place, but the loop continues with the next index, potentially skipping the element that moved into the current position. The function should either iterate backwards or use a different approach to safely remove elements.", "file": "pkg/controller/cassandradatacenter/helpers.go", "line": 127}, {"description": "Potential nil pointer dereference in newCassandraContainer function.
