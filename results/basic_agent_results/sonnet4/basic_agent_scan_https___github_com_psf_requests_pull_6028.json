{"repo_id": "psf_requests_6028", "bugs": [{"description": "In the chunked transfer encoding implementation, the code assumes request.body is iterable without proper validation. At line 472, the code iterates over request.body with 'for i in request.body:', but there's no check to ensure request.body is actually iterable when chunked=True is determined. This could cause a TypeError if request.body is not iterable (e.g., if it's None, a string, or other non-iterable type). The chunked condition is set when 'Content-Length' is not in request.headers, but this doesn't guarantee that request.body is iterable.", "file": "requests/adapters.py", "line": 472}, {"description": "In the HTTPDigestAuth.handle_401 method, there's a potential AttributeError at line 250. The code calls 'r.request.body.seek(self._thread_local.pos)' without checking if r.request.body has a 'seek' method or if it's None. This could cause an AttributeError if the request body doesn't support seeking (e.g., if it's a string, bytes, or other non-seekable object). The code should check if the body has a 'seek' attribute before calling it, similar to how it's handled in the __call__ method at lines 284-291.", "file": "requests/auth.py", "line": 250}, {"description": "In the CaseInsensitiveDict class, the __setitem__, __getitem__, and __delitem__ methods call key.lower() without checking if the key has a 'lower' method or if it's a string. This could cause an AttributeError if a non-string key is passed (e.g., an integer, None, or other object without a 'lower' method). The class documentation states 'All keys are expected to be strings' but there's no validation to enforce this, which could lead to runtime errors.", "file": "requests/structures.py", "line": 51}, {"description": "In the Response.json() method, there's a potential AttributeError at line 915. The code accesses 'e.message' for Python 2 JSONDecodeError exceptions, but not all JSONDecodeError exceptions have a 'message' attribute. In Python 2, some JSON libraries may raise ValueError or other exceptions that don't have a 'message' attribute. This could cause an AttributeError when trying to access e.message. The code should use str(e) or getattr(e, 'message', str(e)) to safely handle different exception types.", "file": "requests/models.py", "line": 915}], "updated_files": {}}
