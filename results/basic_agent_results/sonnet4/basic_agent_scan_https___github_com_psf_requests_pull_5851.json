{"repo_id": "psf_requests_5851", "bugs": [{"description": "The getheaders() method in MockResponse class calls self._headers.getheaders(name) but does not return the result. This means the method always returns None instead of the actual headers, which will cause issues when cookielib tries to extract cookies from responses.", "file": "./requests/cookies.py", "line": 115}, {"description": "The multiple_domains() method has incorrect logic. It checks if cookie.domain is in domains before adding it to the list, but this will only return True if the same domain appears consecutively. It should check if the domain is already in the list after adding the first occurrence. The current logic will miss cases where domains appear in non-consecutive order.", "file": "./requests/cookies.py", "line": 294}, {"description": "The _find_no_duplicates() method has a logic error on line 397. It checks 'if toReturn:' which will fail if the cookie value is falsy (empty string, 0, False, etc.). This means cookies with falsy values will be treated as not found and a KeyError will be raised instead of returning the actual value. It should check 'if toReturn is not None:' instead.", "file": "./requests/cookies.py", "line": 397}, {"description": "In the morsel_to_cookie() function, line 493 sets comment_url=bool(morsel['comment']) which converts the comment to a boolean. However, comment_url should be a URL string or None, not a boolean. This appears to be a copy-paste error where it should likely be morsel['comment_url'] or similar.", "file": "./requests/cookies.py", "line": 493}, {"description": "The LookupDict class inherits from dict but overrides __getitem__ and get methods to look in self.__dict__ instead of the actual dictionary data. This means it ignores any items stored in the dictionary using normal dict operations and only returns instance attributes. This breaks the expected dict interface and could cause confusion or bugs when used as a dictionary.", "file": "./requests/structures.py", "line": 102}, {"description": "In the get_unicode_from_response function, line 591 uses the 'encoding' variable which may be None if no encoding was found from headers. Calling str(r.content, None, errors='replace') will raise a TypeError. The function should check if encoding is not None before using it, or provide a default encoding.", "file": "./requests/utils.py", "line": 591}], "updated_files": {}}
