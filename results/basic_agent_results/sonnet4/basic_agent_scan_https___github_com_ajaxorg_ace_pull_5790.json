On line 127, there's a 'return(err)' statement that should be 'return callback(err)'. This will cause the function to return undefined instead of properly calling the callback with the error, potentially leading to hanging promises or unhandled errors.", "file": "src/test/asyncjs/async.js", "line": 127}, {"description": "Variable 'tearDownCalled' is declared without 'var' keyword on line 97, making it an implicit global variable.
