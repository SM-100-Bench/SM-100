"description": "Path validation in send_js is insecure. The code builds abspath from the user-supplied path without normalizing it (resolve()), so a request like /__weave/file/tmp/local-artifacts/../../etc/passwd passes the local_artifacts_path parent check and allows reading arbitrary files. This enables path traversal."
