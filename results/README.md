# Results
Raw results/traces from evaluation runs.

NOTE: if an output file is not present for a bug, that means there was an error in running. This could be a timeout, system failure, or a lack of output. Except in cases of implementation issues on our side, we _do not_ retry failures as system issues would affect real review work too.
