      "description": "The regex pattern `/(?:^([0-9])|[^a-zA-Z0-9_$])/g` used to sanitize Redis command names causes name collisions. Different commands with special characters (e.g., 'a-b', 'a:b', 'a.b') all transform to the same function name ('a_b'), potentially causing one command to override another."
