      "description": "Buffer overflow vulnerability: The assembly implementation only checks if s.seqSize > maxBlockSize after all sequences are processed, while the generic implementation in seqdec_generic.go checks after each sequence (lines 107-110). This allows s.seqSize to potentially exceed maxBlockSize during sequence processing, which could lead to buffer overflows if the output buffer is allocated based on maxBlockSize."
