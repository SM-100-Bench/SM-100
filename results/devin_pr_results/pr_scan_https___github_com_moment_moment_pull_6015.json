      "description": "Incorrect timezone offset signs for North American time zones (CDT, CST, MDT, MST, PDT, PST). These should be negative values but are defined as positive, causing incorrect time calculations. For example, CDT is defined as 5 * 60 when it should be -5 * 60."

      "description": "Potential bug in weekday validation. The code uses defaultLocaleWeekdaysShort.indexOf(weekdayStr) which expects 3-letter weekday abbreviations, but the RFC 2822 regex (line 100) captures full weekday names. This mismatch could cause valid dates to be rejected."

      "description": "The month parsing uses defaultLocaleMonthsShort.indexOf(monthStr) which assumes English month abbreviations. This will fail for non-English locales, as the function doesn't respect the current locale settings."
