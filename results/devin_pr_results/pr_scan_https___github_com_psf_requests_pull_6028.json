      "description": "Change from urlparse to parse_url alters URL parsing behavior for URLs with ports. Example: 'example.com:80' is now parsed correctly but differently, which could break backward compatibility."

      "description": "The new implementation always sets params to empty string ('') in urlunparse, while the old implementation preserved params. This could cause loss of URL parameters in semicolon-delimited paths."

      "description": "Authentication handling is different between implementations. URLs like 'user:pass@example.com/path' are parsed differently, potentially breaking authentication for certain URL formats."
