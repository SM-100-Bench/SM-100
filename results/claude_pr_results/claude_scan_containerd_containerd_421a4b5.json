If there are running execs but they never send their exit count to the channel (due to a crash, panic, or other failure), this goroutine will block indefinitely, causing a goroutine leak. This could happen if:\n\n1. An exec process fails to call `handleProcessExit` due to an unexpected error\n2. The `s.execCountSubscribers[c]` channel is deleted before all execs finish\n3. Race conditions where the channel is removed while execs are still running\n\nThe code should include a timeout or context cancellation mechanism to prevent indefinite blocking.",
