Generated Python code opens a file but never closes it.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe issue is in the Python generator where `data = open('new_file')` is generated without a corresponding `.close()` call or context manager usage, which will cause file handles to remain open and potentially lead to resource exhaustion.",
