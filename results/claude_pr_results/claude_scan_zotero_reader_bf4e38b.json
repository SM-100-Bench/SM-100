This will cause runtime errors when the `flow` property is accessed (like in line 282: `let cfi = this.flow.startCFI?.toString();`).\n\nThe code appears to be refactoring flow logic into separate classes but hasn't completed the initialization of the `flow` property, which would need to be set to either a `PaginatedFlow` or `ScrolledFlow` instance based on the flow mode.",
