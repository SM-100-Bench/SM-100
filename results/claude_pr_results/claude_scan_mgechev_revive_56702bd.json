This would cause a panic when trying to access `modAst.Go.Version`.\n\n2. **Line 182**: While not a functional bug, there's a grammatical error in the error message that should be corrected for proper English.\n\nThe first issue is the more serious one as it could lead to a runtime panic if the code encounters a `go.mod` file without a `go` directive.",
