    "result": "Based on my review of the staged changes, I can see this is adding functionality to handle inline images that contain `EI` sequences in their binary data. Let me analyze the code for potential bugs:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"issues\": []\n}\n```\n\nThe staged changes appear to be well-implemented with no obvious bugs. Here's what I found:\n\n1. **Import validity**: The imports (`IO` from typing and `WHITESPACES_AS_BYTES` from `_utils`) are valid and exist.\n\n2. **Function implementation**: The `is_followed_by_binary_data` function properly handles stream position restoration, bounds checking, and edge cases.\n\n3. **Stream position handling**: The function correctly saves and restores stream position using `stream.tell()` and `stream.seek(position)`.\n\n4. **Bounds checking**: The function handles empty streams and short data properly.\n\n5. **Logic flow**: The heuristics for detecting binary data vs text operators appear sound, checking for non-printable bytes and operator length limits.\n\n6. **Integration**: The new function is properly integrated into `extract_inline_default()` with appropriate stream seeking and continuation logic.\n\n7. **Test coverage**: Comprehensive tests are added covering various edge cases including empty streams, binary data, whitespace-only content, and different operator lengths.\n\nThe code follows good practices with proper type hints, documentation, and error handling.",
