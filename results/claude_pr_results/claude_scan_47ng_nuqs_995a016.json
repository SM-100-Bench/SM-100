The `ExtractParserType` type uses `ReturnType<Parser['parseServerSide']>`, but `parseServerSide` has different return types depending on whether the parser was created with `.withDefault()`:\n\n- Without `.withDefault()`: returns `T | null` \n- With `.withDefault()`: returns `NonNullable<T>`\n\nThis could lead to type mismatches when using parsers with default values in the serializer, as the extracted type would be non-nullable but the Values type expects it to be nullable/optional.",
