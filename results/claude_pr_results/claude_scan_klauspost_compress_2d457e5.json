    "result": "Based on my analysis of the staged changes, I found several potential issues that represent objectively incorrect behavior. Let me analyze the code systematically:\n\n1. **Array bounds access vulnerability in `adjustOffset` function**: In the generated assembly and the Go code, there's a potential array bounds violation when accessing `s.prevOffset[offset]` (line 555 in seqdec.go). The `offset` value could theoretically be larger than 2, leading to an out-of-bounds access on the 3-element array.\n\n2. **Integer overflow in bit manipulation**: In the assembly generation code, there are several places where bit operations could potentially overflow or produce unexpected results due to lack of bounds checking.\n\n3. **Potential buffer underflow**: In the `adjustOffset` logic, when `temp = s.prevOffset[0] - 1`, if `s.prevOffset[0]` is 0, this will result in -1, which when used as an offset could cause issues.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the specific context and the validation logic already present, most of these potential issues are actually handled by existing checks in the code. The main real issue I can identify is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"issues\": [\n    {\n      \"file\": \"zstd/seqdec_generic.go\", \n      \"line\": 67,\n      \"description\": \"Potential array bounds violation: temp = s.prevOffset[mo] without bounds check on mo value\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, let me double-check the bounds checking logic more carefully by examining the validation in both the assembly generation and the generic implementation...\n\nActually, upon closer inspection, the code does have proper bounds checking. The `mo` variable is constrained by the ZSTD specification and the decoding logic, and the `adjustOffset` function handles all the edge cases properly. The code validates that `mo` can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3 in the context where `s.prevOffset[mo]` is accessed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"issues\": []\n}\n```",
