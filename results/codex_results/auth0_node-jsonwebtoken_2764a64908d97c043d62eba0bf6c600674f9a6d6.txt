"description": "Default algorithm detection uses secretOrPublicKey.toString() which fails when a key object (e.g., { key, passphrase }) is provided. This causes the allowed algorithms list to fall back to HMAC algorithms, producing an invalid algorithm error for RSA/ECDSA keys."

"line": 176,
"description": "Asynchronous signing always passes the key as privateKey to jws.createSign. If the algorithm is HMAC, older versions of jws expect a secret property instead, which may cause signing failures."

"description": "Test executes code outside of any Mocha describe or it block, resulting in side effects (console output) and no actual test assertions."
