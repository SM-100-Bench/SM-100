This could lead to incorrect information in bug reports.\n- Fix the bug in CaseInsensitiveDict.copy() method where it creates a new instance by passing self._store.values() to the constructor, which contains tuples of (key, value) that aren't properly handled by the constructor. The copy method should be modified to correctly create a new instance with the same data.\n- Fix the bug in should_bypass_proxies() function where it creates a generator for no_proxy hosts but then potentially iterates over it multiple times. Since generators can only be iterated once, this could lead to the second iteration being empty. The solution is to convert the generator to a list before using it in multiple code paths.\n- Fix the security vulnerability in extract_zipped_paths() function by adding checks for zip bombs and validating extracted file sizes. Implement a maximum size limit for extracted files and ensure the function safely handles potentially malicious zip files.\n- Fix the security vulnerability in get_netrc_auth() function by adding a check for appropriate file permissions on the .netrc file before reading it. The file should only be readable by the owner to protect sensitive credentials.\n- Fix the atomic_open() function to handle cross-device links by catching the specific OSError (EXDEV) that occurs when os.rename/os.replace fails due to source and destination being on different filesystems. Implement a fallback copy-and-delete approach that maintains atomicity but works across filesystem boundaries.\n- Fix the to_native_string() function in _internal_utils.py to use 'utf-8' as the default encoding instead of 'ascii' to better handle non-ASCII characters. This will prevent UnicodeEncodeError or UnicodeDecodeError exceptions when processing international text or other non-ASCII content.\n- Fix the super_len() function to handle the case where an object's 'tell' method raises an exception more appropriately. Instead of setting current_position to total_length (which results in a length of 0), implement a better fallback mechanism that doesn't assume the position is at the end of the file/stream.\n- Fix the unicode_is_ascii() function in _internal_utils.py to use an explicit type check with a proper exception instead of an assertion. Replace the assertion with a conditional check that raises a TypeError with a descriptive message when the input is not a string, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of Python's optimization flags.","commits":[{"message":"Fix the bug in help.py where 'using_charset_normalizer' is incorrectly set based on chardet being None instead of checking if charset_normalizer is not None.
