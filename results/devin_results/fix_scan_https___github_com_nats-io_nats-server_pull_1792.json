The panic message calls itype.String() which would lead to infinite recursion if called with an unknown item type, causing a stack overflow crash."}, {"file": "conf/lex.go", "line": 680, "description": "Missing EOF check in lexMapDubQuotedKey function, unlike in lexDubQuotedKey.

If the first parse puts the client in an unexpected state, the second parse might behave incorrectly."}]}
