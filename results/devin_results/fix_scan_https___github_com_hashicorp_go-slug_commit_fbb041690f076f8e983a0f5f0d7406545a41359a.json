It only checks if the relative path starts with '..' but doesn't handle cases like 'foo/../../bar' which could still escape the destination directory."}, {"file": "internal/unpackinfo/unpackinfo.go", "line": 69, "description": "Race condition vulnerability in symlink check. The 'continue' statement when a directory doesn't exist skips remaining checks, potentially allowing a symlink attack if a directory is created after this check but before file extraction."}, {"file": "internal/unpackinfo/unpackinfo.go", "line": 152, "description": "Inconsistent error handling in restoreNormal() compared to restoreDirectory(). It doesn't check for os.IsNotExist(err) which could lead to unnecessary error returns for files that were removed during extraction."}, {"file": "internal/unpackinfo/lchtimes_linux32.go", "line": 4, "description": "Incorrect build tags 'linux_amd' and 'linux_arm' are used instead of standard Go build tags '386' for 32-bit x86 and 'arm' for 32-bit ARM."}]}
