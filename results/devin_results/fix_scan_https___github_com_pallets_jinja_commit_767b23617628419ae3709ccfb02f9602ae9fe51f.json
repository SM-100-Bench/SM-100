This could cause runtime errors when a None filename is passed to a function expecting a string."}, {"file": "src/jinja2/lexer.py", "line": 761, "description": "Object of type 'str' is not callable. This indicates a potential confusion between a string token and a Failure object, which could lead to runtime errors."}, {"file": "src/jinja2/lexer.py", "line": 781, "description": "Return type of generator function must be compatible with 'Generator[tuple[int | Any, Failure | str, str | Any], Any, Any]'. This type mismatch could cause issues with the token stream processing."}, {"file": "src/jinja2/parser.py", "line": 513, "description": "Type ignore annotation on return statement may mask real type errors in the parse_assign_target method, potentially allowing invalid assignment targets."}, {"file": "src/jinja2/runtime.py", "line": 144, "description": "Cannot access attribute 'register' for class 'type[Mapping[_KT@Mapping, _VT_co@Mapping]]'.
