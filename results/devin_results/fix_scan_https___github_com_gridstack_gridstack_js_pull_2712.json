If opts is a string like 'disable', 'enable', 'destroy', or 'option', this will cause a runtime error."}, {"file": "src/dd-resizable-handle.ts", "line": 165, "description": "Incorrect loop control: using 'break' instead of 'continue' when encountering a locked node or a node without a rect property. This prevents checking other nodes that might have valid collisions."}, {"file": "src/gridstack-engine.ts", "line": 501, "description": "Potential infinite loop in findEmptyPosition() method. The loop has no termination condition other than finding a position. If the grid is completely full, this could lead to an infinite loop."}, {"file": "src/gridstack-engine.ts", "line": 659, "description": "The node.locked check in moveNode() is commented out (/*node.locked ||*/), which could allow moving locked nodes that should be immovable."}]}
