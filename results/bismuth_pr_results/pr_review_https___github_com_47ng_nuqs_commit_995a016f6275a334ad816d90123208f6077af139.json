    "message": "# Bug Summary for `packages/nuqs/src/serializer.ts`\n\n## Total Bugs Found: 4\n\n### Most Critical Bugs\n\n1. **Serialization Error Handling**: The serializer lacks robust error handling for parser `serialize` methods. If a parser's serialization fails, it would crash the entire serialization process. This could lead to unexpected application failures when working with custom parsers or invalid data.\n\n2. **URL Parsing Vulnerability**: The `splitBase` function doesn't handle malformed URLs safely. Without proper error handling, providing an invalid URL could cause the serialization process to throw unhandled errors, potentially breaking the application's routing or state management.\n\n### Additional Bugs\n\n3. **Optional Parser Method Check**: The serializer assumes all parsers have a `serialize` method, which isn't guaranteed by the type definition. This could lead to runtime errors when using parsers that don't implement serialization.\n\n4. **Lack of Error Logging**: The original implementation didn't provide any error logging or graceful degradation when serialization or parsing fails, making debugging difficult.\n\nThe suggested fixes introduce try-catch blocks, optional method checks, and error logging to improve the robustness and reliability of the serialization process.",
