        "description": "The `extract_zipped_paths` function doesn't handle errors that can occur during extraction, such as:\n\n1. Insufficient disk space in the temporary directory\n2. Insufficient permissions to write to the temporary directory\n3. Corrupted zip files or corrupted files within the zip archive\n\nIf any of these errors occur, the function will raise an unhandled exception, which could cause the application to crash. The fix adds error handling to catch these exceptions and return the original path when extraction fails, along with a warning to inform the user about the issue.\n\nAdditionally, there's no cleanup mechanism for extracted files, which could lead to disk space issues over time as temporary files accumulate. However, this is a separate issue that would require a more comprehensive solution.",
