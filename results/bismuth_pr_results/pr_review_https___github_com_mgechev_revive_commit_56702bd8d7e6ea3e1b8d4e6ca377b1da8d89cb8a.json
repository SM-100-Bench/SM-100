    "message": "## Bug Summary for `lint/linter.go`\n\n### Total Bugs Found: 3\n\n### Critical Bugs:\n1. **Path Manipulation Compatibility**: Multiple functions use `path` package functions for filesystem operations, which do not handle platform-specific path separators. This can cause critical cross-platform compatibility issues, especially on Windows systems.\n\n2. **Root Directory Detection**: The current implementation of root directory checks is incomplete and does not properly handle Windows-style root directories, which could lead to unexpected behavior during file traversal.\n\n### Bug Details:\n- **Location**: `lint/linter.go`\n- **Affected Functions**: `detectGoMod()`, `retrieveModFile()`\n- **Primary Issues**:\n  - Incorrect use of `path.Join()` and `path.Dir()` for filesystem operations\n  - Incomplete root directory detection\n  - Lack of cross-platform path handling\n\n### Potential Impact\nThese bugs could cause the linter to malfunction on Windows systems, potentially preventing proper module file detection and file path traversal.",

        "description": "The code uses `path.Join` and `path.Dir` for file path manipulation, which is incorrect for filesystem operations. These functions are designed for URL path manipulation and use forward slashes regardless of the operating system. For filesystem operations, `filepath.Join` and `filepath.Dir` should be used instead as they handle platform-specific path separators correctly (e.g., backslashes on Windows). This could cause issues when running the tool on Windows systems.",

This won't work correctly on Windows where root directories are represented differently (like `C:\\`). The function should also check for Windows-style root directories using `filepath.VolumeName` to properly handle cross-platform path traversal. Without this fix, the function might not terminate correctly when reaching a Windows root directory.",
