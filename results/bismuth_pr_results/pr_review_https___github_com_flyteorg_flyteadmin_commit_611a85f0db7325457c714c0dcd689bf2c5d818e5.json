    "message": "## Bug Summary for auth/auth_context.go\n\n### Total Bugs Found: 5\n\n### Critical Bugs:\n1. **Nil Pointer Dereference Risk**: In the `OAuth2ClientConfig` method, there's a potential nil pointer dereference that could cause a panic if `requestURL` is nil.\n\n2. **Deprecated Secret Handling**: The `GetOAuth2ClientConfig` function uses a deprecated method for reading client secrets from a file, which has potential security implications.\n\n### Other Bugs:\n3. **Incorrect Error Message**: An error message for block key retrieval contains an incorrect description.\n\n4. **Typo in Field Name**: Multiple instances of a typo in the field name `identityServiceIml` instead of `identityServiceImpl` were found, which could cause confusion and potential runtime errors.\n\n5. **Inconsistent Method Implementation**: The `IdentityService()` method returns a field with an incorrect name.\n\nThese bugs primarily relate to code consistency, error handling, and potential security risks in the authentication context implementation.",
