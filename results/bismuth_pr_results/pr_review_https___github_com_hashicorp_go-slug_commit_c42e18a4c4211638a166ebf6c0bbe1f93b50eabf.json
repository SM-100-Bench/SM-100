        "description": "The `Lchtimes` function in `lchtimes.go` only sets the seconds part of the timestamp when modifying file timestamps, losing nanosecond precision. This can cause issues with applications that rely on precise timestamps, especially for build systems or other tools that make decisions based on file modification times.\n\nThe fix adds the microsecond component by converting the nanoseconds to microseconds (dividing by 1000), which preserves most of the timestamp precision that the original `time.Time` values contain.",
