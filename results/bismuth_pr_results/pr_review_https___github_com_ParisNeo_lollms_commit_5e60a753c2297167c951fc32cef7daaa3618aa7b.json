        "description": "The `calculate` function has several security and type safety issues:\n\n1. **Security Vulnerability**: The current implementation of `eval()` is vulnerable to code injection attacks. While it attempts to restrict the environment by setting `__builtins__` to None and only allowing math functions, there are still ways to exploit this. For example, attackers could use mathematical functions in unexpected ways or craft expressions that access attributes they shouldn't.\n\n2. **Type Inconsistency**: The function signature indicates it returns a float (`-> float`), but it can return a string in case of an exception. This type inconsistency can cause issues for callers expecting a numeric value.\n\n3. **Lack of Input Validation**: There's no validation of the input expression before passing it to `eval()`, which increases the risk of injection attacks.\n\n4. **Information Leakage**: The error handling returns the exception as a string, which could expose sensitive information about the implementation to users.\n\nThe fix:\n- Adds input validation using regex to only allow mathematical expressions with safe characters\n- Ensures the result is a numeric value\n- Returns a consistent type (float) in all cases, using NaN for errors\n- Provides generic error messages to avoid information leakage",

This is likely a copy-paste error.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Text Cleaning**: The `tts_audio` method calls `self.clean_text()` to clean the input text, but the first `tts_file` method doesn't. This inconsistency could lead to different behavior between the two methods.\n\n3. **Missing Documentation**: Both methods lack proper docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.\n\n4. **Parameter Order Inconsistency**: The parameter order in the first `tts_file` method doesn't match the parent class's method signature (it has `speaker` before `file_name_or_path`).\n\nThe fix:\n- Removes the duplicate `tts_file` method\n- Ensures both methods call `clean_text()` for consistent text preprocessing\n- Adds comprehensive docstrings to both methods\n- Fixes the parameter order in `tts_file` to match the parent class's method signature\n- Improves code formatting for better readability",

The method contains duplicated code that performs the same text-to-speech conversion twice, which is inefficient and could lead to unexpected behavior:\n\n1. The method first correctly processes the text, creates the audio, and plays it.\n2. Then it unnecessarily repeats the entire process again - cleaning the text, creating another API request, and writing to the file a second time.\n\nThis duplication wastes resources by:\n- Making two identical API calls to OpenAI instead of one\n- Processing the same text twice\n- Writing to the same file twice\n- Potentially causing race conditions or file corruption\n\nAdditionally, the return value documentation incorrectly states it returns `None` when it actually returns the file path.\n\nThe fix:\n- Removes the duplicated code block\n- Corrects the return value documentation to accurately reflect that it returns the file path\n- Ensures the method returns the speech file path consistently",
