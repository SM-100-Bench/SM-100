        "description": "In the `get_new_command` function, there's no check if `_tar_file(command.script)` returns `None`. If no tar file is found in the command, `_tar_file` returns `None`, and trying to access index `[1]` on `None` will raise an `AttributeError`. This bug would cause the function to crash when processing a command that doesn't contain a valid tar file, even though the `match` function should prevent this from happening. Adding a check for `None` makes the code more robust.",

        "description": "The `side_effect` function has multiple issues:\n\n1. It doesn't check if `_tar_file(command.script)` returns `None`, which would cause an `AttributeError` when accessing index `[0]`.\n2. It uses `tarfile.TarFile` directly instead of the recommended `tarfile.open()`, which could cause issues with different types of tar files.\n3. It doesn't handle errors if the tar file doesn't exist or is invalid.\n4. It tries to remove all files listed in the tar archive without checking if they exist or are files (not directories).\n5. It doesn't handle permission errors when trying to remove files.\n\nThis fix addresses all these issues by:\n- Checking if `tar_info` is `None` before proceeding\n- Using `tarfile.open()` instead of `tarfile.TarFile`\n- Adding error handling for tar file operations\n- Checking if each file exists and is a file before attempting to remove it\n- Handling errors during file removal",
