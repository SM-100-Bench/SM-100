        "description": "The `ImageFallbackDirective` has a potential infinite loop bug. If the fallback image itself fails to load, the error event will trigger again, causing another attempt to set the same fallback image. This creates an infinite loop of error events and fallback attempts.\n\nThe fix adds a flag to track whether a fallback has already been attempted, preventing multiple fallback attempts for the same image element.",
