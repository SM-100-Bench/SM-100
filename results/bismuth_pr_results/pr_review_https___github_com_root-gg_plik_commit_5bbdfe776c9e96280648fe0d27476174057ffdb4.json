        "description": "The comment for the deleteUser function incorrectly states \"Create user\" instead of \"Delete user\". This is misleading and could cause confusion for developers maintaining the code. The function itself is correctly implemented to delete a user (it makes a DELETE request to the appropriate endpoint), but the comment should match the function's purpose.",

The newline character should be removed to maintain consistency with other error messages.",

        "description": "In handlers/user.go, the check to prevent non-admin users from changing their quotas is based on exact value comparison (userParams.MaxTTL != user.MaxTTL || userParams.MaxFileSize != user.MaxFileSize). This check only prevents changes when the values are different, but it doesn't prevent a malicious user from sending a request with the same values as their current quotas and then potentially modifying those values elsewhere in the request flow.\n\nThe fix adds explicit assignment of the original user's quota values to the userParams object after the check, ensuring that even if the values match and pass the check, they will be reset to the original values before being used to update the user object.",
