        "description": "In the `Bz2` method of the `Extractor` struct, there's a bug where it calls the global `Tar` function instead of the method `e.Tar`. This means that when extracting a tar archive from a bz2 file, it doesn't use the custom filesystem implementation provided in the `Extractor` struct.\n\nThis is inconsistent with the `Gz` method which correctly calls `e.Tar` at line 90. The bug causes the `Extractor.Bz2` method to ignore any custom filesystem implementation when handling tar.bz2 files, which breaks the expected behavior of the `Extractor` struct.\n\nThis issue is particularly problematic because:\n1. It defeats the purpose of using a custom FS implementation for tar.bz2 files\n2. It creates inconsistent behavior between Gz and Bz2 methods\n3. There are no tests specifically checking this functionality with a custom FS implementation",
