        "description": "The `lexMapQuotedKey` function has several critical issues:\n\n1. It doesn't handle escaped quotes within map keys. For example, if a key contains `\\\"` or `\\'`, the lexer will incorrectly terminate the key at that point.\n\n2. It doesn't handle any escape sequences at all, unlike `lexString` which properly processes escape sequences like `\\t`, `\\n`, `\\r`, etc.\n\n3. It doesn't properly handle unclosed quotes - it will continue consuming characters indefinitely without reporting an error if it reaches EOF.\n\n4. It doesn't handle newlines within quoted keys, which should be an error.\n\nThe fix adds proper escape sequence handling similar to how `lexString` works, with dedicated functions for handling escape sequences and binary (hex) escapes. It also adds proper error handling for EOF and newlines within quoted keys.",
