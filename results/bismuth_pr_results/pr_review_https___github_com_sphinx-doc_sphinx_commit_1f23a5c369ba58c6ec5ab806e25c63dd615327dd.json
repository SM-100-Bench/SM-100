        "description": "SphinxParallelError does not inherit from SphinxError, which creates inconsistent error handling in the codebase. This means that exception handlers that catch SphinxError will not catch SphinxParallelError, potentially leading to unexpected crashes or different error reporting behavior.\n\nBy making SphinxParallelError inherit from SphinxError, we ensure consistent error handling throughout the application. This change maintains the same string representation behavior while ensuring that any code that catches SphinxError will also catch parallel processing errors.",

        "description": "In the `process_thread` function, if an exception occurs at any point (such as during pipe creation, process start, receiving data, or joining the process), the semaphore will not be released. This can lead to deadlocks because the semaphore controls how many worker processes can run simultaneously.\n\nBy wrapping the code in a try-finally block, we ensure that the semaphore is always released, even if an exception occurs. This prevents potential deadlocks where the main process would be waiting indefinitely for worker processes that never complete due to the semaphore not being released.",

When a KeyboardInterrupt occurs in a worker process, it should be explicitly caught and propagated to ensure proper cleanup.\n\nBy adding explicit KeyboardInterrupt handling, we ensure that when a user interrupts the build, the worker process will properly send the exception back to the main process through the pipe and then re-raise it to terminate itself cleanly. This prevents hanging processes and ensures proper cleanup when a build is interrupted.",

This makes debugging difficult because important context about where the error occurred in the worker process is lost.\n\nBy adding a `get_traceback()` method, we provide a way to access the full traceback when needed for debugging, while keeping the string representation concise for normal error reporting.
