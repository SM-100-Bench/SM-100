The most significant risks include potential file corruption, incorrect API calls, and possible security vulnerabilities related to file path handling.",

        "description": "The code doesn't specify a file mode when opening files for upload, which can cause issues with binary files. When uploading files in Python, especially binary files, the file should be opened in binary mode ('rb') to prevent encoding/decoding issues. Without this mode, binary files may be corrupted during upload.",

No file closing mechanism (context manager)\n3. No error handling for file operations\n4. No escaping of special characters in file paths\n5. No validation of file paths, which could lead to path traversal vulnerabilities\n\nThis fix addresses all these issues by:\n- Using binary mode for file opening\n- Using a context manager (with statement) to ensure proper file closing\n- Adding error handling for file operations\n- Escaping single quotes in file paths to prevent syntax errors\n- Providing meaningful error messages",
