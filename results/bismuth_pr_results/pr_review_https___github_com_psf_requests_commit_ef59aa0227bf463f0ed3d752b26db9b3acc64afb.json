    "message": "## Bug Summary\n\n**Total Bugs Found:** 2 (related to the same issue)\n\n### Critical Bug Details\n\nThe bugs are located in the `prepend_scheme_if_needed` function in `requests/utils.py` and involve incorrect handling of URL parameters during URL reconstruction. \n\n#### Key Issues:\n- Incorrectly setting the `params` component to an empty string (`''`) when using `urlunparse`\n- Potential loss of URL parameters in certain edge cases\n- Mismatch between `parse_url` return tuple (7 components) and `urlunparse` expected tuple (6 components)\n\n### Recommended Fix\n- Pass `None` for the `params` component in `urlunparse`\n- Preserve original URL parameters\n- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing parsing logic\n\nThe suggested fix ensures that URL parameters are not inadvertently stripped during URL scheme prepending or reconstruction.",

        "description": "The `prepend_scheme_if_needed` function is setting the `params` parameter to an empty string (`''`) in the `urlunparse` call, which could potentially cause URL parameters to be lost. \n\nThe `urlunparse` function expects a 6-tuple with components: (scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment). When using `parse_url` from urllib3, the function returns a 7-tuple with components: (scheme, auth, host, port, path, query, fragment), but doesn't include a params component.\n\nThe correct approach is to pass `None` for the params component in `urlunparse`, which preserves the original behavior of not modifying any parameters that might be present in the URL. Using an empty string could potentially strip parameters from the URL in certain edge cases.",
