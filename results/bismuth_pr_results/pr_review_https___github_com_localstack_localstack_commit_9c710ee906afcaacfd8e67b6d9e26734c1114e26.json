    "message": "# Bug Summary for localstack/services/s3/v3/provider.py\n\n## Total Bugs Found: 2\n\n### Critical Bugs:\n- **HeadObject Checksum Handling**: In the HeadObject handler, there is an undefined variable `checksum` being referenced when attempting to set the checksum value in the response. This would cause an error when a client requests a HeadObject operation with ChecksumMode=ENABLED on an object with a checksum algorithm.\n\n### Bug Details:\n1. The code attempts to use a non-existent `checksum` variable when setting the response checksum.\n2. The correct variable to use is `s3_object.checksum_value`.\n3. The bug is inconsistent with other parts of the code (like GetObject handler) which correctly use `s3_object.checksum_value`.\n\n### Potential Impact:\n- Breaks HeadObject functionality for objects with checksums\n- Prevents proper checksum reporting in S3 object metadata\n- Would cause runtime errors when specific S3 operations are performed",

In line 744, the code attempts to use a variable named 'checksum' when setting the checksum value in the response, but this variable is not defined anywhere in the function. \n\nThe correct value to use is `s3_object.checksum_value`, which is the checksum value stored in the S3Object. This is consistent with how the same functionality is implemented in the GetObject handler at line 654, which correctly uses `s3_object.checksum_value`.\n\nThis bug would cause an error when a client requests a HeadObject operation with ChecksumMode=ENABLED on an object that has a checksum algorithm defined.",
