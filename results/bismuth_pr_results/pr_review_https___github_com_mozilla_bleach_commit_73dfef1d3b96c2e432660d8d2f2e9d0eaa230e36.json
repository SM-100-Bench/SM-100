        "description": "There's a bug in the `convert_entities` function where it checks `if part:` instead of `if remainder:` after calculating the remainder. Since `part` has already been checked for truthiness earlier in the function (line 116), this condition will always be true, which could lead to appending empty remainders to the result. This is inconsistent with the similar code in `sanitize_characters` which correctly checks `if remainder:` (line 534).",

        "description": "In the `sanitize_uri_value` function, there's a security issue where URLs without protocols are automatically assumed to be \"http\" if http is allowed. This could lead to security issues with non-http URLs that should be treated differently. The function should explicitly check if the URL is a relative URL (starting with '/') before assuming it's an http URL, which would provide better security by not automatically allowing potentially malicious URLs.",
