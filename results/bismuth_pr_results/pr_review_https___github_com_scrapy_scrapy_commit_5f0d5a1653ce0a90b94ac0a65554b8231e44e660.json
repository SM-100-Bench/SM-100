      {
        "description": "There's a case inconsistency in the `from_headers` method. The code checks for 'Content-Type' (with capital T) in the headers, but then tries to access it with 'Content-type' (lowercase t). This inconsistency could cause KeyErrors when the header exists but can't be accessed with the wrong case. The Headers class is case-insensitive, but direct dictionary access is case-sensitive.",
