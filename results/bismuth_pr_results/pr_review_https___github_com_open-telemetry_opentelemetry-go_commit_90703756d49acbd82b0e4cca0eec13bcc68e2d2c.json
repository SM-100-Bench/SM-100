        "description": "In the `NetAttributesFromHTTPRequest` function, when port parsing fails (line 68), both `peerName` and `peerIP` are set to empty strings, discarding potentially valid host information that was already parsed. This is problematic because it means that any malformed port in the RemoteAddr will cause the entire peer information to be lost, even though the host part might be perfectly valid.\n\nThe bug can lead to missing attributes in telemetry data, as valid peer information is discarded due to an unrelated port parsing error. This reduces the quality and completeness of the collected telemetry data.\n\nThe fix keeps the already parsed host information intact when port parsing fails, which ensures that valid host information is preserved in the telemetry data regardless of port parsing issues.",

        "description": "The `HTTPServerAttributesFromHTTPRequest` function blindly trusts the X-Forwarded-For header without any validation. This is a security vulnerability when the application is behind multiple proxies.\n\nThe current implementation simply takes the first value from the X-Forwarded-For header array, which can be easily spoofed by malicious clients. In a multi-proxy setup, the X-Forwarded-For header typically contains a comma-separated list of IPs, with the leftmost being the client and subsequent ones being the proxies it passed through.\n\nAn attacker could inject a fake IP at the beginning of this list, which would then be recorded as the client IP in telemetry data. This could be used to:\n1. Bypass IP-based rate limiting or security controls\n2. Falsify the source of attacks in logs\n3. Potentially gain access to IP-restricted resources\n\nThe fix improves the handling by:\n1. Adding a warning comment about the security implications\n2. Extracting only the first IP from a comma-separated list (rightmost untrusted IP)\n3. Trimming whitespace for better reliability\n\nA complete fix would involve validating the proxy chain against known trusted proxies, but that would require configuration beyond the scope of this function.",

        "description": "In the `NetAttributesFromHTTPRequest` function's host parsing loop (lines 84-107), there's a bug where `hostPort` is reset to 0 when `hostPart` is empty. This can discard a valid port that was previously found in an earlier iteration of the loop.\n\nThe function iterates through multiple potential host sources (`request.Host`, `request.Header.Get(\"Host\")`, and `request.URL.Host`), and for each one, it attempts to extract both the host part and port. If a valid port is found in an early iteration but the host part is empty, the code will reset the port to 0 and continue to the next source. This means that if a later source has a valid host but no port, the previously found valid port will have been discarded.\n\nThis can lead to incomplete network attribute information in telemetry data, where a valid port is available but not included in the attributes.\n\nThe fix removes the unnecessary reset of `hostPort` when `hostPart` is empty, allowing a valid port from an earlier iteration to be preserved and used with a valid host from a later iteration.",

This type of panic can crash the application or service, leading to downtime and potential service disruption.\n\nThe fix adds a simple nil check at the beginning of the function that returns an empty attributes slice when the request is nil.
