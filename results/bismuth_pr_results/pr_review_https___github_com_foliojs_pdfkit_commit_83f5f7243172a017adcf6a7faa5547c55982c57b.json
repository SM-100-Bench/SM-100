These bugs pose potential security risks and compatibility issues with newer Node.js versions.\n\n## Bug Details\n- **Affected Files**:\n  - `lib/image/png.js`\n  - `lib/image.js`\n  - `lib/reference.js`\n  - `lib/document.js`\n  - `lib/object.js`\n\n- **Primary Issue**: Deprecated `new Buffer()` constructor usage\n- **Risks**:\n  - Security vulnerabilities\n  - Memory leaks\n  - Compatibility issues with Node.js v6.0.0+ \n\n## Recommended Action\nReplace all instances of `new Buffer()` with:\n- `Buffer.from()` for converting existing data\n- `Buffer.alloc()` for creating new buffers with specific sizes\n\nThis will ensure safer memory allocation and compatibility with modern Node.js versions.",
