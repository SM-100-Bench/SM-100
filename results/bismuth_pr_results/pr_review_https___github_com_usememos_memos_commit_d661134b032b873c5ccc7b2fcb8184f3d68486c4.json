    "message": "# Bug Summary Report\n\n## Total Bugs Found: 7\n\n### Most Critical Bugs:\n1. **SQL Query Parameter Omission**: In `store/user.go`, the `createUser` function has SQL query placeholders without corresponding values, which could lead to SQL errors or data corruption.\n\n2. **Session Cookie Security Vulnerability**: In `server/jwt.go`, session cookies are not configured securely, potentially exposing sensitive session information and making the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks.\n\n3. **Database Schema Foreign Key Mismatch**: In `store/seed/10001_schema.sql`, there's a foreign key constraint referencing the wrong table name, which could cause database integrity issues.\n\n### Bug Categories:\n- Error Message Inconsistencies: 3 bugs\n- Security Vulnerabilities: 1 bug\n- SQL Query Errors: 2 bugs\n- Database Schema Issue: 1 bug\n\n### Detailed Bug Locations:\n- `server/memo.go`: Incorrect error message for GET endpoint\n- `server/auth.go`: Incorrect error messages for signup process\n- `server/jwt.go`: Grammatically incorrect error message and insecure cookie configuration\n- `store/user.go`: SQL query parameter and syntax issues\n- `store/seed/10001_schema.sql`: Foreign key constraint error",
