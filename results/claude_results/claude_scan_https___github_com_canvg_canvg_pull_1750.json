This violates TypeScript's type safety and could potentially cause runtime errors if the code tries to access properties on these null values before they are properly initialized. The proper fix would be to either make the type nullable (`IPoint | null`) or initialize with a default point object.", "total_cost": 0.52025575, "session_id": "78382d21-bd79-4914-9a99-9ba44a0cfdf3"}]}
